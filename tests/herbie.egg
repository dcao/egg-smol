;; Analyses
;; --------
;; This example has three analyses:
;; an interval analysis consisting of a hi and lo component
;; and a non-zero analysis.
;; The non-zero analysis is built off the interval analysis (in order to prove
;; that rewrites are sound, even if some parts of an expr can't be const-evaled)

; TODO: unbounded intervals?
(function hi (Math) Rational :merge (min old new))
(function lo (Math) Rational :merge (max old new))
(relation non-zero (Math))

;; First, constant folding!
;; We don't need an explicit constant folding analysis, we can just union
;; with nums when we can

;; - There exists a lo interval, in which case it must be larger than 0
;; - There exists a hi interval, in which case it must be smaller than 0
